# Areas of Interests
<div style="height: 1em;"></div>

I have broad interests in ecology, be it theoretical or empirical, pure or applied. In particular, I am most interested in the following research topics and questions: 

<div style="height: 1em;"></div>

* __Climate change ecology:__
  - How climate-driven geographical/phenological shifts and the resulting spatial/temporal synchrony/asynchrony affect the dynamics between interacting species
  - How individuals, populations, and communities respond to multifaceted nature of global environmental changes—means, variations, and extremes
  - Effects of multiple stressors (e.g., warming, drought, elevated CO~2~) on various ecological levels: physiology and behavior of organisms, population dynamics, species interactions, community structure, ecosystem functions

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

* __Trophic ecology:__ 
  - Quantification of the relative importance of top-down vs. bottom-up effect in food web dynamics involving multi-trophic interactions and feedback/feed-forward mechanisms
  - How within-trophic-level interactions (e.g., cannibalism, intra-guild predation) affect across-trophic-level interactions (e.g., predator-prey dynamics)
  - Partitioning of the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of predators on prey population dynamics 
  - Using stable isotopes to determine the resource use of consumers and the degree of intra-guild predation
  - What factors affect the diet compositions of generalist predators—prey preference, foraging mode, prey availability, environmental conditions, etc.  

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

* __Species interactions:__ 
  - How interactions between assemblages of predators affect prey populations 
  - Predator-induced eco-evolutionary dynamics in prey
  - How above- and below-ground fauna cross-talk with each other
  - Competition between C~3~ and C~4~ plants and its ecological consequences in higher trophic levels
  - What the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors is in determining species range limits

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

* __Community ecology:__ 
  - Drivers of community assembly processes—priority effects, dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, biotic interactions
  - Island biogeography in urban and agro-ecosystems—species dynamics in habitat patches within highly disturbed matrix

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

* __Agro-ecology:__ 
  - How climate changes affect crop-pest-enemy multi-trophic dynamics and biological control 
  - Habitat manipulation and agricultural practices to enhance ecosystem services in agro-ecosystems

<div style="height: 1em;"></div>

Ecology, as an encompassing discipline, should be integrative and interactive rather than fragmented and isolated. I am not limiting myself to only these areas and always open to any cool ideas that spark my interests!

I have over six years of experience in R programming relevant to statistical analysis and modeling. I really value these "weapons", which give me the ability to tackle the research questions I would like to answer. Now I still keep arming myself with new quantitative skills. Never stop learning!

I am also interested in data wrangling and visualization: creating awesome ggplot2 figures for effective science communication really brings me a great source of joy and achievement!
