# Areas of Interest
<div style="height: 1em;"></div>

I am most interested in topics related to species interactions. To put it in a broad context, I would like to adopt **multiple approaches** (observational, experimental, and modeling) to examine how **multiple drivers** (abotic and biotic) affect **multi-trophic interactions** (primary producer, herbivore, predator, and parasitoid), and how these effects scale up over **multiple biological organizations** (individual, population, community, ecosystem) and across **multiple temporal and spatial levels** (organismal, ecological, evolutionary). 

Here are some of the research directions/questions I would like to work on in the future:

<div style="height: 0.5em;"></div>

* __Species Interactions and Trophic Ecology:__ 
  - Quantifying the relative importance of top-down vs. bottom-up forces in governing the dynamics of food webs involving multi-trophic interactions and feedback/feed-forward processes
  - How within-trophic-level interactions (e.g., cannibalism, intra-guild predation and omnivory) alter among-trophic-level interactions (e.g., predator-prey interactions)
  - What factors affect the resource use and diet compositions of generalist predators—developmental stage, prey preference, foraging mode, prey availability, environmental conditions, etc.   
  - How assemblages of predators interact to exert consumptive and non-consumptive effects on prey and subsequently influence predator-prey eco-evolutionary dynamics 

<div style="height: 1em;"></div>

* __Climate Change Ecology:__
  - Competition between C~3~ and C~4~ plants in response to environmental changes and its ecological consequences for higher trophic levels
  - How climate-driven phenological/geographical shifts and the resulting spatial/temporal synchrony/asynchrony influence the population dynamics of interacting species
  - How individuals, populations, and communities respond to multi-faceted nature of environmental changes (means, variations, and extremes)
  - Effects of multiple stressors (e.g., warming, drought, elevated CO~2~) on the physiology and behavior of organisms, intra- and inter-specific interactions, species abundances and distributions, community structure, ecosystem functions, etc.
  - Comparing the performance and fitness of generalists vs. specialists under changing environments
  
<div style="height: 1em;"></div>

* __Community Ecology:__ 
  - Quantifying the relative importance of abiotic and biotic dirvers (e.g., priority effects, dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, biotic interactions) in determining species distributions and community structure
  - Island biogeography in urban and agro-ecosystems—species dynamics in habitat patches embedded within highly-disturbed matrix

<div style="height: 1em;"></div>

* __Agro-ecology:__ 
  - How environmental changes (e.g., warming) affect crop-pest-enemy dynamics and biological control 
  - Designing management schemes (e.g., habitat manipulation) to enhance ecosystem services/reduce ecosystem dis-services in agro-ecosystems

<div style="height: 1em;"></div>

Ecology, as an encompassing discipline, should be integrative and interactive rather than fragmented and isolated. I am not limiting myself to any particular areas and always open to cool ideas that spark my interests!

I have over six years of experience in R programming relevant to statistical analysis and modeling. I really value these "weapons", which provide me the ability to tackle the research questions I would like to answer. Now I still keep arming myself with new quantitative skills. Never stop learning!

I am also interested in data wrangling and visualization: creating awesome ggplot figures for effective science communication really brings me a great source of joy and achievement!
