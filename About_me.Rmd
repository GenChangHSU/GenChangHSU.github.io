My name is Gen-Chang Hsu, an undergraduate at the Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University. I sprouted my interests in biology since high school, during which I have been participating in the [2014 International Biology Olympiad](https://www.ibo-info.org/en/contest/past-ibos.html){target="_blank"} and awarded a gold medal.

Fascinated by the exquisite relationships between organisms and environments, ecology has become my favorite field and I have developed broad interests in various ecological questions. I am also interested in data science. Check out my <a href="./Research.html">Research</a> page for more information!

My Bachelor's thesis, advised by Professor [Chuan-Kai Ho](https://ecology.lifescience.ntu.edu.tw/doku.php/en/ckho/start){target="_blank"}, focused on using stable isotopes to examine arthropod predator-prey trophic interactions in rice agro-ecosystems. I have successfully defended my thesis and the work has later been published in the journal [*Ecosphere*](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21508925){target="_blank"}. These research experiences have strengthened my determination to pursue a career in ecology and evolutionary biology.

Outside of work, I enjoy outdoors like hiking, biking, and photography, as well as table tennis and cooking. Traveling around the world is my lifetime goal.
