I sprouted my interests in biology since high school, during which I participated in the 2014 International Biology Olympiad and was awarded a gold medal. Fascinated by the exquisite relationships between organisms and the environment, ecology since became my favorite field of biology and I have developed broad interests in various ecological topics. I am also into data science and visualization. Check out my [Research](https://genchanghsu.github.io/Research.html) page for more information.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University. My Bachelor’s thesis, advised by [Dr. Chuan-Kai Ho](https://ecology.lifescience.ntu.edu.tw/doku.php/en/ckho/start){target="_blank"}, focused on using stable isotopes to examine arthropod predator-prey trophic interactions in rice agro-ecosystems. Later, I worked as a research assistant in [Dr. Po-Ju Ke’s lab](https://pojuke.com/) studying the temporal decay trajectory of plant-soil microbe interactions. We combined greenhouse experiments and microbial analysis to explore how conditioning history affects soil microbial communities and in turn influences seedling performance and vegetation dynamics.

Currently, I am a PhD student in [Dr. Jennifer Thaler’s lab](https://blogs.cornell.edu/thaler/) working on plant-herbivore-predator tri-trophic interactions and chemical ecology of predator and prey. I hope my research can have real-world applications and contribute to agricultural sustainability.

In my free time, I enjoy biking, hiking, bird watching, and photography. Traveling around to explore this n-dimensional world is my lifetime goal!
