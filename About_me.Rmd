I am Gen-Chang Hsu, a young seedling ecologist ready to stretch out my shoots and roots. I sprouted my interests in biology since high school, during which I have been participating in the [2014 International Biology Olympiad](https://www.ibo-info.org/en/contest/past-ibos.html){target="_blank"} and awarded a gold medal.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University. My Bachelor’s thesis, advised by [Dr. Chuan-Kai Ho](https://ecology.lifescience.ntu.edu.tw/doku.php/en/ckho/start){target="_blank"}, focused on using stable isotopes to examine arthropod predator-prey trophic interactions in rice agro-ecosystems. I successfully defended my thesis and published the work in [*Ecosphere*](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.3625){target="_blank"}. I have also worked as a teaching assistant for the course [_Introduction to Theoretical Ecology_](https://genchanghsu.github.io/2021_Fall_Introduction_to_Theoretical_Ecology/){target="_blank"} by Dr. Po-Ju Ke, extending my interests into ecological theories and mathematical modeling.

I am currently a research assistant at [Dr. Po-Ju Ke’s lab](https://pojuke.com/), studying the temporal decay trajectory of plant-soil microbe interactions and its effects on seedling performance. This project will provide insights into how plant conditioning history affects the soil microbe communities and in turn influence forest regeneration and vegetation dynamics.

Fascinated by the exquisite relationships between organisms and environments, ecology is my favorite field of biology at all times and I have broad interests in various ecological topics. I am also into data science and visualization. Check out my [Research](https://genchanghsu.github.io/Research.html) page for more information.

In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and photography. I also love playing table tennis and cooking. Traveling around to explore this n-dimensional world is my lifetime goal!
