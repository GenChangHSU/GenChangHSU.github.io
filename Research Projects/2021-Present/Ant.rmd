# Active ant hitchhiking on vehicles and its ecological implications
</div>

<br>

## Project Summary
<div style="height: 0.25em;"></div>

Species hitchhiking on human transportation objects such as vehicles can facilitate
long-distance dispersal of organisms, allowing increased probabilities of successful
biological invasions. In Taiwan, there have been observations of ants actively moving onto motor vehicles (defined as ‘ant hitchhiking’ hereafter), yet no study has
explored this phenomenon.

<div style="height: 1em;"></div>

Here, we provide the first qualitative and quantitative report on ant hitchhiking
behaviour using citizen science data. From 2017 to 2023, 52 cases of ant hitchhiking on vehicles were reported (at least three cases with queen[s] and another eight
cases with brood), attributed to nine species. Seven of the nine species were
exotic/invasive. Arboreal or semi-arboreal ant species, particularly the exotic black
cocoa ant (Dolichoderus thoracicus), accounted for over half of the reported cases.
The parking duration of the vehicles on which the ants hitchhiked ranged from several hours to over a month (30 cases occurred within a day). Moreover, more cases
were reported in the warmer seasons (spring and summer) than in the colder seasons (fall and winter).

There are three determinants of a successful ant hitchhiking events.

To our knowledge, this study represents the first effort to profile active ant hitchhiking on vehicles. We encourage future studies to examine the abiotic and biotic
factors that determine the success of hitchhiking events to better predict the
spread of exotic/invasive ants and to develop effective management strategies for
preventing their biological invasions
