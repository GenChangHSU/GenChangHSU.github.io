# Climate Change Ecology

<br>

*	Impacts of multiple stressors on organisms: How do multiple climate change variables (temperature, precipitation, CO~2~, etc.) jointly affect species performance and interactions as well as community structures and ecosystem functioning?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

*	Integrating biological responses to temperature warming across levels of biological organization: How can warming-induced changes in individualsâ€™ traits and species interactions be scaled up to predict population dynamics and community structures?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

*	Effects of temperature variation and extremes on biological responses: What is the importance of temperature variation and extremes in determining species performance and fitness consequences?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

*	Novel interactions and mismatches: How will climate-induced phenological and geographical shifts in organisms affect their temporal and spatial synchrony/asynchrony and in turn result in novel interactions and mismatches?

* Chemical ecology under climate change: How will climate change affect chemical communications between and among plants, herbivores, and natural enemies and in turn their trophic interactions?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

* The role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering short-term and long-term environmental changes: Does short-term acclimation via phenotypic plasticity facilitate or impede long-term adaptation via evolutionary changes?
