# Climate Change Ecology

<br>

*	Impacts of multiple environmental stressors on organisms: How multiple climate change variables jointly affect species performance and trophic interactions?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

*	Integrating biological responses to temperature warming across levels of biological organization: How can we scale up from changes in individualsâ€™ traits and species interactions to predict population dynamics and community structure?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

*	Effects of environmental variations and extremes on biological responses: What are the importance of variations and extremes vs. means in determining species performance and fitness consequences?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

*	Novel interactions and trophic mismatches: How climate-driven phenological/geographical shifts and the resulting temporal/spatial synchrony/asynchrony alter species interactions?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

* Chemical ecology under climate change: How climate change affects the chemical communications among plants, herbivores, and predators and in turn their trophic interactions? 

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

* The role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering short-term and long-term environmental changes: Will short-term acclimation facilitate or impede long-term adaptation?
