# Climate Change Ecology

<br>

* __Climate Change Ecology:__
  - How multiple stressors (e.g., warming, drought, and elevated CO~2~) affect the performance of organisms, both directly via physiological/behavioral/functional traits and indirectly via species interactions, and how these effects scale up to influence the abundance and distribution, spatial patterns, food web structure, community composition, ecosystem productivity and biogeochemical cycling, etc.
  - How climate-driven phenological/geographical shifts and the resulting temporal/spatial synchrony/asynchrony influence the population dynamics of interacting species
  - Comparing the performance and fitness of generalists vs. specialists under changing environments
  - The effects of multi-faceted nature of climate change—changes in mean conditions, variations, and the frequency of extremes—on biological responses
