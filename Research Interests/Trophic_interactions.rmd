# Trophic Interactions

<br>

* Ecology of plant defenses against herbivores: How do various abiotic and biotic factors affect the relative importance of physical vs. chemical, direct vs. indirect, and induced vs. constitutive plant defenses against herbivores? 

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

* Indirect effects of predators on plants: What is the relative importance of density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect effects of predators on plants?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

*	Factors influencing the diet compositions of organisms: How do resource availability, resource attractiveness and preference, energy and nutritional requirement, foraging behavior and hunting mode, predation risk, and ontogeny jointly affect the diet compositions of organisms?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

*	The strength of consumptive and non-consumptive predator effects: How do various abiotic and biotic factors influence the strength of consumptive vs. non-consumptive predator effects in different types of ecosystems?

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

*	Predator-predator interactions and multi-predator effects: How do assemblages of predators with different foraging modes, habitat domains, and dial activity patterns interact to affect prey populations?   

<div style="height: 0.1em;"></div>

* Intraguild predation, omnivory, and cannibalism: How do the levels of intraguild predation, omnivory, and cannibalism vary among different ecosystems and their impacts on food web dynamics?
