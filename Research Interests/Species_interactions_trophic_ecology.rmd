# Species Interactions/Trophic Ecology

<br>

* __Species Interactions and Trophic Ecology:__ 
  - Quantifying the relative importance of top-down vs. bottom-up forces in governing the dynamics of food webs involving multi-trophic interactions and feedback/feed-forward processes
  - How within-trophic-level interactions (e.g., competition and intra-guild predation) affect among-trophic-level interactions (e.g., plant-herbivore and predator-prey) as well as their ecological consequences for population dynamics
  - What factors determine the resource use and diet compositions of generalist predatorsâ€”developmental stage, prey preference, foraging mode, prey availability, inter- and intra-specific competition, environmental conditions, etc.   
  - How assemblages of predators interact to exert consumptive and non-consumptive effects on prey and subsequently influence predator-prey eco-evolutionary dynamics, and how the relative importance of consumptive vs. non-consumptive effects varies with abiotic and biotic conditions.
